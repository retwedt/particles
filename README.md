# Particles

This particle demo is a project from Course 3 Advanced JavaScript at CodeAbode.  Particles served as a fun graphic demonstration of advanced JavaScript concepts like constructor functions and prototypes.  Students began by hard-coding a single particle.  After demonstrating that this method would not scale effectively, students were introduced to constructor functions.  Constructor functions were used to easily make groups of particles that could be added to a scene with minimal code.

This project used the following technologies:

-	[P5.js](http://p5js.org/) - a creative coding library for simplifing canvas scripting

## Other Versions

Particle Burst \[[download zip](https://github.com/retwedt/particles/archive/burst.zip)] \[[link](https://github.com/retwedt/particles/tree/burst)\] - Click anywhere on the screen and particles will burst from your cursor!  Particles are affected by gravity and fade over time.  [View the live version here](http://rextwedt.com/particles/)

Fireworks \[[download zip](https://github.com/retwedt/particles/archive/fireworks.zip)] \[[link](https://github.com/retwedt/particles/tree/fireworks)\] - Click anywhere on the screen and particles will burst from your cursor!  After a few moments, these particles will split into several smaller particles, before eventually fading.

Vector Collisions \[[download zip](https://github.com/retwedt/retwedt.github.io/archive/version-2.zip)] \[[link](https://github.com/retwedt/retwedt.github.io/tree/version-2)\] - WORK IN PROGRESS.  Adding vector based movement and collisions to the particle system.
